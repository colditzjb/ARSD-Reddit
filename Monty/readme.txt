Templates: (relevant to Karen and Quinton)
1. base: contains the beginning of each html file
2. index: fake user dashboard file for testing app.py
3. subreddit: the page generated by each subreddit link in the index file

how to use: 
the index file should open first. click the links to get to different subreddit pages. the index should be replaced w/ the actual user dashboard.

Python files:
app.py:
 1. database models: my design for stuff that might be added to the database. (relevant to Lydon and Henry)
 2. dummy data: this is some random's subreddit account. this should be replaced with the authenticated user. (relevant to Karen and Quinton)
 3. site functions: the different functions of the site, see descriptions in each function for deets (relevant to everyone)
 4. app.route('/'): logic for the fake dashboard (index template) (relevant to everyone)
 5. app.route('/subreddit/<name>'): logic for the subreddit pages (subreddit template). (relevant to everyone)
 
 Example:
