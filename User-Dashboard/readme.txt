This is based off of Monty's code, with some of the bootstrap UI from Henry.

index.html:
There are 6 div containers for the charts. The script section for the charts is at the bottom of the file.

app.py:
Has the functions and routes. def home() is where I put the stuff for my chart, but I probably should've made a function.

base.html:
Has bootstrap stuff and css styles.
